# 📝 Fund Me Project Setup and Introduction

## 📖 Foreword
Welcome to the second section of Foundry Fundamentals. In this section, we'll cover **Fund Me**, a simple funding contract.

### What You Will Learn:
- How to push your project to GitHub.
- Writing and running tests.
- Advanced deploy scripts for different chains.
- Using scripts to interact with contracts.
- Using a price feed.
- Utilizing Chisel.
- Smart contract automation.
- Making contracts more gas efficient.
- Understanding storage and state variables.

## 📂 Project Overview

### Fund Me Contract:
- Located in the `src` folder.
- Key points:
  - Named error: `FundMe__NotOwner()`
  - Constants: All caps naming convention
  - Immutable variables: Prefix with `i_`
  - Private variables: Prefix with `s_`

---

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Project

### Steps to Create and Navigate the Folder:
1. Clone the project locally and open VS Code.
2. Ensure you are in the `foundry-f23` folder.

### Commands to Create and Open a New Folder:
```bash
mkdir foundry-fund-me-f23
cd foundry-fund-me-f23
code .
```

### Initializing a Foundry Project:
- Run the following commands:
  ```bash
  forge init
  ```
  Or
  ```bash
  forge init --force
  ```
- Foundry will populate the project with initial files (Counter files, script, main contract, test).

---

## 🛡️ Understanding FundMe Contract

### Key Points in `FundMe.sol`:
- Use of advanced tools and standard naming conventions:
  - Named errors, constants, immutable variables, private variables.

---

## 📂 Counter Contracts

### **Counter.sol**
- A simple smart contract that stores a number.
- Key functions:
  - `setNumber(uint256 newNumber)`: Sets a new number.
  - `increment()`: Increments the stored number by 1.
- **Note**: `number++` is equivalent to `number = number + 1`.

### **Counter.s.sol**
- Just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything.

### **Counter.t.sol**
- This file is crucial as it contains tests for the Counter contract.
- The test folder will become essential throughout this course.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests with Foundry

### **Command to Run Tests**:
```bash
forge test
```

### **Test Output Includes**:
- Number of tests found.
- The file in which they were found.
- Test results (pass or fail).
- Summary of test execution.

### **How `forge test` Works**:
- `forge test` has various options to configure tests, display results, and specify test environments.
- To explore options:
  ```bash
  forge test --help
  ```
- Recommended to read further in the Foundry Book.

---

## ⚙️ **Understanding `forge test` Execution**:
- Forge identifies all files in the test folder.
- Runs the `setUp` function.
- Searches for public/external functions starting with `test` and executes them.
- Runs all `assert` statements; if all are true, the test passes, otherwise, it fails.

---

## 📂 Clean Up and Setup

### **Delete Counter Files**:
- Remove the Counter files that Foundry prepopulated.

### **Create New Files**:
- In the `src` folder, create `FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol`.
- Copy the contents from the Remix Fund Me repo.

### **Compile the Project**:
- Run `forge compile` or `forge build`. Errors may appear due to missing dependencies.

### **Fixing Import Errors**:
- The imports `{AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";` may cause issues.
- Install dependencies manually:
  ```bash
  forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
  ```

### **Understanding Forge Install Command**:
- Specify the GitHub repository path and version (branch, tag, or commit).
- `--no commit` prevents creating a git commit.

### **Lib Folder**:
- Contains `forge-std` (installed automatically) and `chainlink-brownie-contracts` (installed manually).
- Check for `AggregatorV3Interface` in `chainlink-brownie-contracts`.

### **Remappings in foundry.toml**:
- Add remappings to direct imports correctly:
  ```toml
  remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']
  ```
- Recompile the project:
  ```bash
  forge compile
  ```

### **Fixing Dependencies**:
- Ensure proper GitHub repository paths and remappings match imports.

## 🎯 Summary

In this lesson:
- We set up the FundMe project and explored the contract.
- Organized our development environment using Foundry.
- Ran and understood tests using `forge test`.
- Cleaned up unnecessary files and resolved import errors with remappings.

Stay tuned for the next lessons where we dive deeper into smart contract development and testing!

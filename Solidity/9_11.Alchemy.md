# 🧪 Alchemy: A Game Changer for Decentralized Application Development
**Lecture Date**: 1st March 2025

## 🚀 Overview
Alchemy is an innovative platform that simplifies decentralized application (dApp) development by providing APIs, SDKs, and libraries. Often referred to as the **"AWS of Web3"**, Alchemy offers a reliable and efficient developer experience for Web3 projects. It powers thousands of applications, including those from industry leaders like Adobe, Shopify, and Stripe.

## 🔎 What is Alchemy?
- Alchemy acts as both a **node provider** and a **developer tooling platform**.
- It supports Web3 and Web2 applications by:
  - Handling blockchain infrastructure.
  - Simplifying data access with **Enhanced APIs**.
  - Reducing the need for developers to manage their own nodes or pipelines.

Think of it as a bridge between developers and blockchain technology, making your workflow faster and more efficient.

## ⚙️ How Does Alchemy Work?

### 🛠️ **Supernode**: The Core Engine
- Alchemy’s **Supernode** is a proprietary blockchain engine that:
  - Acts as a load balancer on top of your node.
  - Ensures real-time, up-to-date blockchain data access.
- Built on top of the Supernode are tools like **Enhanced APIs** and monitoring features.

### 🔗 **Multi-Chain Support**
Alchemy supports multiple blockchain networks, including:
- **Ethereum**
- **Polygon PoS**
- **Polygon zkEVM**
- **Optimism**
- **Arbitrum**
- **Solana** (non-EVM chain)

## 📊 The Application-Specific Dashboard
Once your application is active, you’ll have access to an intuitive dashboard that provides insights such as:
1. **Latency**
2. **Compute Units**
3. **Transaction Success Rate**
   - Use the **"Recent Invalid Requests"** tab to debug failed transactions.
   - View reasons for transaction failures and fix them efficiently.

## 🔍 Mempool Watcher: Deep Transaction Tracking
Alchemy’s **Mempool Watcher** is a powerful debugging tool that tracks:
- **Transaction status** (e.g., mined, pending, dropped).
- **Gas used** and **time for validation**.
- **Sender and receiver addresses**.
- Transaction values.

This enables a granular understanding of pending transactions, helping you debug specific transaction-related issues with ease.

#### Previous Lesson Recap
In a previous lesson, you learned how to use a `.env` file to store your private key and RPC URL. However, there have been developments, and it's now recommended **not to use a `.env` file** for sensitive information.

### Encrypting Your Keys Using ERC2335

#### Scenario
Let's assume your private key is:
```
0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```
This is a key generated by Anvil (a local Ethereum node for testing).

#### Step 1: Import the Wallet

To securely store your private key, you can use the following command:
```sh
cast wallet import nameOfAccountGoesHere --interactive
```
- **What Happens Here**:
  - You will be prompted to enter your private key and a password.
  - The password encrypts your private key, ensuring it is not stored in plain text.
  - You only need to do this once, which secures your key and simplifies future operations.

#### Step 2: Deploying with the Encrypted Key

Previously, you used a command like this to deploy a contract:
```sh
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

With the new secure setup, you can deploy using:
```sh
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --account nameOfAccountGoesHere --sender 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266
```
- **What Happens Here**:
  - You will be prompted to enter the password you set earlier.
  - The deployment process will use the encrypted private key.
  - This ensures that even if someone gains access to your commands, they cannot see your private key.

#### Additional Commands

- **List All Configured Wallets**:
  - Use the following command to see all wallets you've set up:
    ```sh
    cast wallet list
    ```
  
- **Clear Command History**:
  - To make sure your private key doesn't remain in the terminal history, clear it using:
    ```sh
    history -c
    ```

### Key Points to Remember
- **Encrypt Your Keys**: Always use encryption for your private keys to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure Deployment**: Deploy contracts using encrypted keys and passwords for enhanced security.
- **Avoid Plain Text**: Never store or use your private key in plain text in the command line or `.env` files for production environments.

### Important Reminders
- If you see your private key in plain text, you're doing something wrong and need to revisit your security practices.
- Secure your keys, stay safe, and avoid exposing sensitive information.

# How to Not Have Your Private Key in the Command Line

## The Problem
In a previous lesson, we deployed `SimpleStorage` using the following command:

```sh
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Having our private key in plain text in the command line is very risky. What can we do to avoid this, aside from using the `--interactive` parameter?

**BIG BOLDED DISCLAIMER: What we are about to do is fine for development purposes, do not put a real key here. It is very dangerous for production purposes.**

## Solution: Using Environment Variables

### Step 1: Create a .env File
- In the root of your project, create a new file called `.env`.
- Ensure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` file to keep it out of version control.

### Step 2: Add Sensitive Information
Open the `.env` file and add your private key and RPC URL:
```sh
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

### Step 3: Load Environment Variables
Run `source .env` to add the environment variables to your shell. Verify they are loaded with:
```sh
echo $PRIVATE_KEY
echo $RPC_URL
```

### Step 4: Update Forge Script Command
Replace the sensitive parameters in your command:
```sh
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

This approach hides your private key from plain sight and facilitates faster terminal usage, making it cleaner and more efficient.

## Handling This Problem in Production

### Keystore Option
Foundry offers an option called `keystore`. To learn more, type `forge script --help` in your terminal. Use:
```sh
forge script --keystore <PATH>
```
This specifies a path to an encrypted store file, protected by a password, ensuring your private key is not in plain text.

### Best Practices
1. For testing purposes, use a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in an `.env` file, but do not expose the `.env` file publicly.
2. For real money transactions, use the `--interactive` option or a keystore file protected by a password.

## Important Reminder
Storing private keys in `.env` files is not safe for production. Always follow best practices to keep your keys secure.

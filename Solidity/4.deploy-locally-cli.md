# Foundry - Deploying Contracts with Forge

## Deploying Contracts Using Command Line

### Command:
```sh
forge create <fileName> --rpc-url <URLof that network> --interactive
```

### Description:
The `forge create` command is used to deploy Solidity contracts directly from the command line. This command allows you to specify the file containing your contract, the RPC URL of the network you want to deploy to, and enables interactive mode for additional inputs during deployment.

### Parameters:
- `<fileName>`: The file name of the Solidity contract you want to deploy (e.g., `src/MyContract.sol`).
- `<URLof that network>`: The RPC URL of the Ethereum network you want to deploy to (e.g., `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`).

### Additional Inputs During Deployment:
When using the `--interactive` flag, you may be prompted to provide additional inputs such as:
1. **Constructor Parameters**: Values required for the contract's constructor.
2. **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on the deployment.
3. **Nonce**: The transaction nonce (if not automatically managed).
4. **Gas Price**: The price per unit of gas (if not automatically managed).

### Example:
```sh
forge create src/MyContract.sol --rpc-url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID --interactive
```

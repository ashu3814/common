# Foundry - Deploying Contracts with Forge

## Deploying Contracts Using Command Line

### Command:
```sh
forge create <fileName> --rpc-url <URLof that network> --interactive
```

### Description:
The `forge create` command is used to deploy Solidity contracts directly from the command line. This command allows you to specify the file containing your contract, the RPC URL of the network you want to deploy to, and enables interactive mode for additional inputs during deployment.

### Parameters:
- `<fileName>`: The file name of the Solidity contract you want to deploy (e.g., `src/MyContract.sol`).
- `<URLof that network>`: The RPC URL of the Ethereum network you want to deploy to (e.g., `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`).

### Example:
```sh
forge create src/MyContract.sol --rpc-url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID --interactive
```

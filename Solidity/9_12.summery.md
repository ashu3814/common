# 🎉 Celebrating Milestones in Foundry: A Complete Walkthrough of Our Recent Project
**Lecture Date**: 2nd March 2025

## 📝 Overview
Completing an entire project in Foundry is no mean feat. Congratulations on your hard work and determination! This document recaps everything we learned in our project and prepares us for the next steps, including advancing our Foundry skills, pushing projects on GitHub, and familiarizing ourselves with advanced tooling.

## 🌟 Key Takeaways from the Project

### 🛠️ **Creating a New Foundry Project**
- We started by using **Forge** and **Knit** to create a new Foundry project.
- These tools provided a structured, professional environment with organized folders.

### 🗃️ **Foundry’s Basic Commands and Their Functionalities**

1. **Cast**:
   - Interacts with contracts that have been previously deployed.

2. **Forge**:
   - Compiles and interacts with our contracts.

3. **Anvil**:
   - Deploys a local blockchain, similar to Ganache.

### 🌐 **Understanding Transactions with MetaMask**
- Sending a transaction via MetaMask is like making an HTTP post request to a particular RPC URL.
- RPC URLs can be obtained from node-as-a-service providers like **Alchemy** for direct transactions from Foundry projects.

### 📜 **Compiling and Deploying Solidity Scripts**
- Practical knowledge on compiling code in Foundry.
- Writing Solidity scripts for deployment.
- Ensuring the security of private keys using an `.env` file (note: not advisable to use plain text keys for real money transactions).

## 🔄 **Contract Deployment and Interaction**

### 🚀 **Automating Contract Deployments**
- We automated contract deployments to the blockchain.

### 🔧 **Interacting with Deployed Contracts**
- Using `cast send` to make transactions.
- Using `cast call` to read from contracts.

### 🖊️ **Auto Formatting Contracts**
- Learned to auto format contracts with:
  ```bash
  forge format my_contract.sol

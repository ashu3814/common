## Foundry Commands

### Forge
`**forge**` is used for **building**, **testing**, and **deploying** smart contracts. It streamlines the development process by managing dependencies and running tests efficiently.

### Cast
`**cast**` is a command-line tool for **interacting** with smart contracts and **sending transactions**. It simplifies contract interaction and transaction management.

### Anvil
`**anvil**` is a local **Ethereum development node** that allows developers to **test** and **debug** smart contracts in a controlled environment.

### Chisel
`**chisel**` is a **Solidity REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that provides an interactive environment for **writing** and **testing** Solidity code snippets.

# Creating a New Foundry Project

## Command to Create a New Project

To create a new Foundry project, use the following command:

```sh
forge init MyProject
```

Replace `MyProject` with your desired project name.

## Important Folders and Their Descriptions

### src
The `src` folder contains the main Solidity source files for your project. This is where you write and store your smart contracts.

### lib
The `lib` folder is used to store external libraries and dependencies. It helps manage third-party libraries that your project relies on.

### test
The `test` folder contains test files for your project. This is where you write and store tests for your smart contracts to ensure they function as expected.

### script
The `script` folder is used for deployment and migration scripts. This folder helps you automate the deployment of your smart contracts.

### out
The `out` folder contains the compiled output of your Solidity contracts. It includes the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and bytecode for your contracts.

## Steps to Create a New Foundry Project

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - On macOS, you can open the Terminal application by pressing `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight Search, then type "Terminal" and press Enter.

2. **Run the Command**:
   - Copy the command `forge init MyProject` and paste it into the Terminal.
   - Replace `MyProject` with your desired project name.
   - Press Enter to execute the command.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to change to your new project directory:
   ```sh
   cd MyProject
   ```

4. **Explore the Folders**:
   - Open the project directory in your code editor (e.g., VS Code) to explore the created folders and their contents.

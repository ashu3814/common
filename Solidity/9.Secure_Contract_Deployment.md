# Deploying Smart Contracts: Old Way vs. New Way

## Introduction
Deploying smart contracts is a fundamental part of blockchain development. Over time, practices have evolved to enhance **security**, **efficiency**, and **ease of use**. This document outlines the transition from the old method to the new method of deploying contracts, highlighting the key differences and advantages of the new approach.

## The Old Way: Direct Use of Private Keys

### Method
In the past, deploying a contract involved using Forge and passing sensitive information directly into the command line, like so:
```bash
forge script script/MyContract.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### Issues with the Old Way
1. **Plain Text Private Keys**:
   - The private key was directly exposed in the command line, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

2. **Repeated Manual Input**:
   - The RPC URL and private key had to be entered repeatedly, increasing the risk of errors.

3. **Basic Security Measures**:
   - No encryption for the private key, which left it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

## The New Way: Encrypted Wallets with ERC2335

### Method
With the new method, private keys are encrypted and securely stored. Deployment is managed using a wallet account and a password.

1. **Encrypting the Private Key**:
   - Import and encrypt the private key with the following command:
     ```bash
     cast wallet import nameOfAccountGoesHere --interactive
     ```
   - You will be asked for:
     - **Private Key**: To securely save the key.
     - **Password**: To encrypt and protect the private key.

2. **Deploying the Contract**:
   - Once the wallet is configured, use the following command for deployment:
     ```bash
     forge script script/MyContract.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast --account nameOfAccountGoesHere --sender <SENDER_ADDRESS>
     ```
   - This method prompts for your wallet password instead of exposing your private key.

3. **List Configured Wallets**:
   - To see all configured wallets, use:
     ```bash
     cast wallet list
     ```

4. **Clear Command History**:
   - To prevent sensitive information from lingering in your shell history, run:
     ```bash
     history -c
     ```

## Key Differences Between the Old Way and New Way

| Feature              | Old Way                                                | New Way                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Security**         | Plain text private key in commands.                   | Encrypted private keys with password.       |
| **Ease of Use**      | Repeated manual input for private keys and RPC URLs.   | One-time setup of encrypted wallet accounts. |
| **Exposure Risk**    | High risk of exposing sensitive keys.                  | Low risk with encrypted key storage.        |
| **Authentication**   | Direct private key input.                             | Password-driven, adding an extra layer of security. |

## Advantages of the New Way

1. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Encrypted private keys are stored securely, ensuring they are never exposed in plain text.
2. **Simplified Workflow**:
   - Keys and accounts are imported and protected once, avoiding repeated manual input.
3. **Password Protection**:
   - Deployments require a password, providing an additional layer of security even if your system is compromised.
4. **Future Compatibility**:
   - The method aligns with **ERC2335 standards**, making it more future-proof.

## Final Thoughts

Transitioning from the old to the new deployment method is crucial for secure and efficient blockchain development. The new approach not only reduces the risks of key exposure but also streamlines the deployment process.

By embracing these updated practices, you ensure that your workflow is secure, modern, and adheres to best practices in blockchain development.
